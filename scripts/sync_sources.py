"""Fetch pinned plugin READMEs and the Cadasto brand layer.

Plugin READMEs land in `.fetched/`. Brand files from `Cadasto/docs-theme`
land on their live paths (`extra_css`, `custom_dir`, `docs_dir/assets`).
Copying either here would guarantee drift, so both are pulled at build time
from a pinned ref. `sources.json` is the single place a version is named.
`scripts/catalog_pins.py` checks each source against the marketplace manifest.

Rewriting of install Markdown happens here rather than in a MkDocs hook on
purpose: a hook sees the `--8<--` include line, not the included text, so it
could never fix links inside fetched content. Doing it at fetch time is also
deterministic and testable.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/sync_sources.py            # fetch, fail if unreachable
    python3 scripts/sync_sources.py --offline  # reuse cached copies
    # Makefile wraps these as `docs-sync` / `docs-sync-offline`.
