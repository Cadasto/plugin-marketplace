"""Assert the three hand-maintained lists of fetched brand paths agree.

`sources.json` `theme.files[].dest` is the source of truth. The same six paths
are repeated in `.gitignore` (so fetched content cannot be committed) and in the
Makefile's `THEME_FETCHED` (so `make docs-clean` reaps them). Nothing in the build
notices when they drift, and each drift fails silently in its own way: a path
missing from `.gitignore` makes fetched content committable, reintroducing the
second copy this repository exists to avoid; a path missing from
`THEME_FETCHED` survives `make docs-clean` and is then reused by `--offline`
indefinitely.

Run from the repository root. Exits non-zero with the difference on drift.
